# How to Contribute

Contributions are greatly appreciated. The maintainers of Config Sync monitor issues
and PRs and strive to provide timely feedback and reviews. For any questions or 
suggestions, reach to to the Config Sync maintainers on [issues]
or [discussions].

For small bug fixes and doc updates, just create a PR with your change. 
ConfigSync follows the [Kubernetes contribution process], so fork the project,
create a change and then submit a PR against the `main` branch which is
the HEAD of development.

For larger changes and for anything that has a change to the CLI and API please
write a [design document] first. This is to make sure the change is aligned with
the direction of the project and doesn't conflict with other planned features.
If you want input from the maintainers or the community before the design is
completed, just create a WIP PR.

For faster reviews on PRs, make sure that the PR doesn't contain any conflicts
and that all the checks are passing.
